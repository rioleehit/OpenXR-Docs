*Overview*

This extension enables an application to show the passthrough image to see
the surrounding environment from the VR headset.
The application is allowed to configure the passthrough image with the
different appearances according to the demand of the application.

The passthrough configurations that runtime provides to applications
contain:

* Decide the passthrough layer shown over or under the frame submitted by
  the application.
* Specify the passthrough form with full of the entire screen or projection
  onto the mesh specified by the application.
* Set the alpha blending level for the composition of the passthrough layer.

*Create a passthrough handle*

[open,refpage='XrPassthroughHTC',type='handles',desc='Represents a passthrough.']
--
An application can: create an slink:XrPassthroughHTC handle by calling
flink:xrCreatePassthroughHTC.
The returned passthrough handle can: be subsequently used in API calls.

The flink:xrCreatePassthroughHTC function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreatePassthroughHTC.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession in which the passthrough will be
  active.
* pname:createInfo is a pointer to an slink:XrPassthroughCreateInfoHTC
  structure containing information about how to create the passthrough.
* pname:passthrough is a pointer to a handle in which the created
  slink:XrPassthroughHTC is returned.
****

Creates an slink:XrPassthroughHTC handle.

If the function successfully returned, the output pname:passthrough must: be
a valid handle.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:form elink:XrPassthroughFormHTC that specifies the form of
  passthrough.
****

[open,refpage='XrPassthroughFormHTC',type='enums',desc='Describes the form of passthrough.',xrefs='']
--
The elink:XrPassthroughFormHTC enumeration identifies the form of the
passthrough, presenting the passthrough fill the full screen or project onto
a specified mesh.

The flink:xrDestroyPassthroughHTC function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrDestroyPassthroughHTC.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:passthrough is the slink:XrPassthroughHTC to be destroyed.
****

The flink:xrDestroyPassthroughHTC function releases the passthrough and the
underlying resources.

*Composite the passthrough layer*

[open,refpage='XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC',type='structs',desc='A composition layer for passthrough',xrefs='XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader']
--
The slink:XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain, such as slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC.
* pname:layerFlags is a bitmask of elink:XrCompositionLayerFlagBits
  describing flags to apply to the layer.
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace that specifies the layer's space - must:
  be dlink:XR_NULL_HANDLE.
* pname:passthrough is the slink:XrPassthroughHTC previously created by
  flink:xrCreatePassthroughHTC.
* pname:color is the slink:XrPassthroughColorHTC describing the color
  information with the alpha value of the passthrough layer.
****

The application can: create an slink:XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC
structure with the created pname:passthrough and the corresponding
information.
A pointer to slink:XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC may: be submitted in
flink:xrEndFrame as a pointer to the base structure
slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader, in the desired layer order, to request
the runtime to composite a passthrough layer into the final frame output.

If the passthrough form specified to flink:xrCreatePassthroughHTC is
ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_FORM_PROJECTED_HTC,
slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC must: appear in the pname:next
chain.
If they are absent, the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

[open,refpage='XrPassthroughColorHTC',type='structs',desc='The alpha value of the passthrough']

The slink:XrPassthroughColorHTC structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrPassthroughColorHTC.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:alpha is the alpha value of the passthrough in the range [0, 1].
****

The application can: specify the slink:XrPassthroughColorHTC to adjust the
alpha value of the passthrough.
The range is between 0.0f and 1.0f, 1.0f means opaque.

The slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:vertexCount is the count of vertices array in the mesh.
* pname:vertices is an array of slink:XrVector3f.
  The size of the array must: be equal to vertexCount.
* pname:indexCount is the count of indices array in the mesh.
* pname:indices is an array of triangle indices.
  The size of the array must: be equal to indexCount.
* pname:baseSpace is the slink:XrSpace that defines the projected
  passthrough's base space for transformations.
* pname:time is the basetype:XrTime that defines the time at which the
  transform is applied.
* pname:pose is the slink:XrPosef that defines the pose of the mesh
* pname:scale is the slink:XrVector3f that defines the scale of the mesh
****

The slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC structure describes the mesh and
transformation.

The application must: specify the slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC in
the pname:next chain of slink:XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC if the
specified form of passthrough layer previously created by
flink:xrCreatePassthroughHTC is ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_FORM_PROJECTED_HTC.

Passing slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC updates the projected mesh
information in the runtime for passthrough layer composition.

If slink:XrPassthroughMeshTransformInfoHTC is not set correctly, runtime
must: return error ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE when flink:xrEndFrame
is called with composition layer slink:XrCompositionLayerPassthroughHTC.
